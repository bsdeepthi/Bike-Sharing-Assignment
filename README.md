## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain       in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and     the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- Company wants to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
      Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
      How well those variables describe the bike demands
- Business goal is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with     
       different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way 
       for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- A large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors is used for this analysis.

## Conclusions
1. Rentals has increased drastically in 2019 when compared to 2018 
2. Rentals are more on Thu, Fir, Sat and Sun  as compared to the start of the week.  
3. Rentals are almost equal either on working day or non-working day.  
4. Rentals was more when weathersit was 1 ( Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy) 
5. Rentals was more during the month of September,October,November 
6. Rentals is increased during the fall of the season

Based on the above conclusions we can predict that company should equip itself to fullfill the demand during fall of the season. Since there is around 30% of increse in demand from 2018 to 2019, similar increase can be expected in the coming year also.
